# MangoHUD Config File
# First used GOverlay, then configured it myself

# -- Toggling & Logging --
# You can use Shift_L and Shift_R
toggle_hud=F11 # Not using F12 because that's a screenshot in Steam
toggle_logging=Shift_L+F2
upload_log=F5
output_folder=/home/stankovictab

# -- FPS Settings --
# Works perfectly for 3D Era GTA games as they need 30 FPS for correct physics
fps_limit_method=late # If FPS limiter should wait before or after presenting a frame. Choose late (default) for the lowest latency or early for the smoothest frametimes
toggle_fps_limit=F10 # Cycle between FPS limits (needs at least two values set with fps_limit). Defaults to Shift_L+F1
fps_limit=0,30,60,165 # Limit the apps framerate. Comma-separated list of one or more FPS values. 0 means unlimited
fps_sampling_period=500 # Default is 500ms

# -- Layout -- 

legacy_layout=false
# pci_dev=0:23:00.0
# pci_dev = 0000:01:00.0

# NOTE: Sometimes there's an issue where GPU stats aren't being picked up, don't know what causes it
# On some games it works, on some it doesn't, it may be related to it being VKD3D rendered, Vulkan, etc
# Maybe running `NODEVICE_SELECT=1 mangohud` might fix it in the future

resolution # When using gamescope, the monitor resolution is the render resolution, so it works nicely with it. When not using gamescope it displays the monitor resolution (instead of the render resolution) even if it's set to lower in the game. My thinking for this is that Proton does this, because maybe it uses FSR under the hood at all times? Not sure.
