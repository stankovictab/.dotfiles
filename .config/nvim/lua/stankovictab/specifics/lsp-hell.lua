-- Config for Everything LSP --

-- In order to add support for a language, add it in the ensure_installed list in mason-lspconfig (or just install it with :Mason), and then add lspconfig's .setup(), that's what actually enables the language
-- You should go to nvim-lspconfig's server_configurations.md to see the setup for that language, it may have something other than just .setup()
-- Also, it's important to note that mason and lspconfig, for some reason, name their language servers differently - here you need to use lspconfig's names
-- https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md

-- Each one can have it's own on_attach function, which is called when the language server is attached to the buffer
